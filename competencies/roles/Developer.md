Overview

This role involves applying technical skills to create solutions for users. It encompasses
people working in code with front or backend technologies across teams working on internal 
or external tools. Developers tend to work closely with TechLead, Design and Product roles. 


As well as the role specific competencies below, all tech roles in properly involve
