		<!--- Emerging Tech Design and Implementation -->	
			1. Given tech design goals can identify a development approach to breaking down a problem. <br/> 
			2. Can evaluate and compare two pieces of code with provided design goals <br/>
			3. Can develop code and tests within an agreed design structure, can contribute to the design discussion <br/>
		</td>
		<td>
		<!--- Emerging System Design -->
			In multi component or complex systems: <br/>
			1. Can design for specified system characteristics with support (e.g. latency vs throughput vs resilience) <br/>
			2. Can conduct testing on system attributes when highlighted to them. <br/>
			3. Understands and accepts importance of system design, and understands that relative importance is situational and has a cost <br/>

		<!--- Proficent System Design -->
			In multi component or complex systems: <br/>
			1. Routinely considers most important system characteristics in designs (e.g. latency vs throughput vs resilience) <br/>
			2. Actively develops and tests for relevant system issues (what happens in failure, how is the latency) <br/>
			3. Routinely raises system relevant system design factors, and helps team disregard irrelevant (latency on background process, testability of one time script) <br/>

			1. Foresees pitfalls in technical approaches early, and takes steps to understand and avoid when appropriate. <br/>

		<!--- Authority System Design -->
			In multi component or complex systems: <br/>
			1. Demonstrated ability to build simple and clear systems that seem like they would have to be complex <br/>

			3. Influences system design company wide, and beyond. Transmits/nutures mental model and system techniques to team mates <br/>
			4. Can effectively introduce scaled system design changes (typically long term change) effectively <br/>
