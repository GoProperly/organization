			<strong>Emerging</strong>
		</td>
		<td>
		<!--- Emerging Tech Design and Implementation -->	
			1. Given tech design goals can identify a development approach to breaking down a problem. <br/> 
			2. Can evaluate and compare two pieces of code with provided design goals <br/>
			3. Can develop code and tests within an agreed design structure, can contribute to the design discussion <br/>
		</td>
		<td>
		<!--- Emerging System Design -->
			In multi component or complex systems: <br/>
			1. Can design for specified system characteristics with support (e.g. latency vs throughput vs resilience) <br/>
			2. Can conduct testing on system attributes when highlighted to them. <br/>
			3. Understands and accepts importance of system design, and understands that relative importance is situational and has a cost <br/>
		</td>
		<td>
		<!--- Emerging Development Process and Improvement -->
			1. Values and adopts team norms related to the development process (testing, release, code review, tech decisions) <br/>
			2. Can respond to request for input or feedback on how a particular process worked. <br/>
			3. Recognizes a connection between process/practice and outcome, and open to experimenting with process changes <br/>
		</td>
		<td>
		<!--- Emerging Communication -->
			1. Verbally explains technology they are familiar with clearly to peers. <br/>
			2. Organizes written materials for peers clearly. <br/>
			3. Basic communication skills awareness such as turn taking (both speaking up, and leaving space) in group settings. <br/>

			<strong>Proficent</strong>
		</td>
		<td>
		<!--- Proficent Tech Design and Implementation -->
			1. Routinely identifies multiple approaches as implementing solutions. <br/> 
			2. Collaborates on tech approaches, routinely provides valuable ideas in design and code review <br/>
			3. Influences immediate team on tech design and design criteria. <br/>
			4.Routinely undertakes the most complicated areas of the system successfully. <br/>	 
		</td>
		<td>
		<!--- Proficent System Design -->
			In multi component or complex systems: <br/>
			1. Routinely considers most important system characteristics in designs (e.g. latency vs throughput vs resilience) <br/>
			2. Actively develops and tests for relevant system issues (what happens in failure, how is the latency) <br/>
			3. Routinely raises system relevant system design factors, and helps team disregard irrelevant (latency on background process, testability of one time script) <br/>
		</td>
		<td>
		<!--- Proficent Development Process and Improvement -->
			1. Advocates and incorporates processes that have been successful for them in the past (testing, release, code review, tech decisions) <br/>
			2. Mental model of the impact of particular processes, actively identifies processes that don't seem to be effective <br/>
			3. Has a "reason for practice/process change" framework and seeks out ways of improving their craft <br/>
		</td>
		<td>
		<!--- Proficent Communication -->
			1. Aware of audience, verbally explains ideas appriate to audience and setting, able to get input. <br/>
			2. Aware of audience, and organizes written materials for different audiences clearly. <br/>
			3. Brings focus to group communication settings, and able to amplify others contributions, confirm understanding to others,  and ensure their key points are heard. <br/>
		</td>
		<td>
		<!--- Proficent Technical Change -->
			1. Understands tradeoffs between major technical systems and approaches <br/>
			2. Demonstrated ability to support and contribute to long term or high impact changes <br/>
			3. Recognizes the human and team connection to big changes.

			<strong>Authority</strong>
		</td>
		<td>
		<!--- Authority Tech Design and Implementation -->
			1. Foresees pitfalls in technical approaches early, and takes steps to understand and avoid when appropriate. <br/> 
			2. Recognized by peers as someone to ask for input and help.  <br/>
			3. Influences design criteria throughout the company and beyond. <br/>
			4. Demonstrated ability to solve technical solutions that have been a barrier to the team. <br/>
			5. Can strengthen the design of a system and introduce new technologies effectively <br/> 
		</td>
		<td>
		<!--- Authority System Design -->
			In multi component or complex systems: <br/>
			1. Demonstrated ability to build simple and clear systems that seem like they would have to be complex <br/>
			2. Able to ask key questions of product and wider organization to get at key systems properties and how they will change over time <br/>
			3. Influences system design company wide, and beyond. Transmits/nutures mental model and system techniques to team mates <br/>
			4. Can effectively introduce scaled system design changes (typically long term change) effectively <br/>
		</td>
		<td>
		<!--- Authority Development Process and Improvement -->
			1. Sought out by team, and across company and beyond for how to make teams more effective (can articulate changes and processes that make sense  - maturity model) <br/>
			2. Identifies and triggers improvements to processes or practices to make a team better; Exemplary personal practices <br/>
			3. Demonstrated alignment and achievement of business goals through reasoned improvement of process and practices. Strategic. <br/>

		<td>
		<!--- Authority Communication -->
			1. Aware of audience both in general and situationally (are people following, excited, worried). <br/>
			2. Audience and objective interactions in written communication (writing for learning, writing for influence, etc.) . <br/>
			3. Use of rhetorical and communication techniques (emotional language, repetition) for both information exchange, shared understanding and emotional tone. . <br/>
			4. Use of deliberate facilitation techniques, group meetings are more effective when they are present. <br/>
			5. Improves others communication through feedback and editing, communicates broadly outside of team <br/>
