            "<b>Emerging</b>" communication is generally scoped to intra-team activities, demonstrating effectiveness
            (in delivery, comprehension, and clarification) within the immediate team, and only occasionally presenting
            material for feedback across engineering teams.
            <br><br>
            Demonstration of "<b>Proficient</b>" for engineering roles expands beyond the immediate team and involves
            inter-team discussions and facilitating larger meetings effectively (e.g. eng town hall, guilds, lunch and
            learns, DEPO and beyond). There is heightened focus on active listening, understanding different opinions
            and perspectives, and engaging in those discussions. Also increasing expectation of written content and
            presentations as a communication medium.
            <br><br>
            Engineering members demonstrating "<b>Authority</b>" in this competency are able to achieve high
            comprehension with a variety of audiences when communicating complex technical concepts (e.g. in design
            docs, PR reviews, QBRs, planning, cross-functional meetings). They are aware of nuances in communication
            (e.g. tone, body language, word choice) and able to use these effectively in different situations for varied
            outcomes (e.g. lower stress in "high stakes" conversations, rally team to a cause, redirect conversations
            towards goals or optimism or commitment, blameless retrospectives to surface improvements).
