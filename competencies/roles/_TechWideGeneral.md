### Interpreting Business Acumen

Business acumen in a technology team context has two main dimension, one is core subject of
our business (in the case of Properly today: customers buying and selling, the real estate industry)
and the other is the technology business (role of cloud computing trends, major technology company business structure options)

#### Examples of Emerging
##### Real Estate
Aware of the most relevant aspects of Canadian real estate in order to contextualize the 
broader work that we are doing. Examples of the type of information: 
- the agent system and fee structure (percent of cost, billed on sell side, billed from buyer agent to seller agent)
- the reasons why buying first can be hard 
  - risk of 2 homes and qualifying for 2 mortgages, unknown value of home you 
  are selling 
  - risk of 0 homes and not getting a suitable new home, managing the gap time
- Understanding our system (estimating the sale price, discounting to unlock equity)

Contextualization activities that can come from this for a technology team can include
- Able to evaluate why our ability to estimate the sale price quality is relevant
- Able to understand the degree of structure around selling and why our system tends to pair them
(what you want to do is move but your current home matters so much)
- Distinguishing multiple stakeholders in the code and using our systems (ourselves, agent partners, end users)
and variants of their headspace (users thinking about new home or about financing, users thinking about existing home)


##### Technology

Aware of the most relevant trends and levers in technology industry, in order to identify good patterns
and contribute to technical experiments
- Role of managed services in reducing effort of a team and increasing a team's ability to focus on their 
core offering
- Role of cloud technologies in elasticity and on demand availability
- DevOps role in enabling frequent small (lower risk) releases and encouraging maintainable/operable software
- Trends in languages and tools and the role in fast development and maintainable development

Contextualizes tech decisions such as

- Understand why we don't always build and operate our selves
- Understand that some technical choices are hard to change and important
- Understand that branching, release, testing and other strategies that affect the developer experience 
can affect quality and effectiveness (and how that can improve user experience, business outcomes, and recruiting) 

#### Examples of Proficient
##### Real Estate
Aware of current or nuanced trends Canadian real estate and actively uses those in the broader work. Examples of the type of information:
- The idea of balanced vs sellers vs buyers market (and the idea of uncertainty) to inform what work might be a priority
  - e.g. confidence tools vs move fast on dream home vs affordability
- The effect of interest rates on affordability and how to think about overall business risk of slowdown 
(comfort with taking decreasing business risk, awareness (resilience) that the cycle will pass  )
- The effect of home value and of uncertainty on our business model, and ability to contribute ideas on how to take
benefit or avoid negative impact.
- New opportunities created by changing dynamics (e.g. Properly has broader capabilities and context than realtors or banks)

This experience and knowledge on the real estate side for a tech team member helps them contribute to prioritization and approach with
product and design partners

##### Technology

Deeply aware of and reasoning about current or more nuanced movement in the technology space, examples
- Platform ownership and what that might mean (e.g. Looker owned by google)
- Team trends around practices (e.g. trends in testing and quality, security and privacy practices - e.g. Apple positioning)
- Discerning about tradeoffs with vendors and effect of their business model on our scaling (how to think about Algolia vs Elastic Search models)

This experience and connectedness to technology trends enables a team member to contribute more effectively
in planning and in system design activities by identifying future needs and the technology and vendor trends 
that are likely to be tailwinds or headwinds to our technical delivery.
