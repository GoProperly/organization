DataScience at Properly includes machine learning but also data analysis and statistics. The role works closely 
with [Developers](./Developer.md)/[DataEngineers](./DataEngineer.md) but also with Product roles.  Excellence
 in data science will require adopting some of the practices and skills of those roles. 
 
 As well as the role specific competencies below, all tech roles in properly involve
