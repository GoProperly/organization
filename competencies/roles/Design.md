As a tech leader your biggest measure of success is the progress your team makes. 
This appears in both the value your team is able to deliver, but more importantly 
in team well being/effectiveness and an increase in team members capabilities and career growth.

		<!--- Proficent User Research -->
			1. Capable of using extensive of tools to access user needs and feedback (interview, survey, labs/focus groups, card sort, tree map, mood/sentiment, journey mapping, ...). <br/> 
			2. Capable of planning effective and appropriate research efforts in a given area or question.
