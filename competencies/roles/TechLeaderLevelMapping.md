Comparing the role of team lead to engineering manager: 

A team lead would typically be operating a conventional team process associated with delivery, often the default process for teams in the organization. Teams would revise that process modestly through a retrospective process. A team lead is self-sufficient in helping a team deliver in largely happy path project scenarios - reasonable time scales, good partner product team member, solid team member skills, etc.  Team leads would typically rely on partnership (and in many cases follow the direction of) their manager on complex projects or supporting team member issues or in staffing changes.  

In contrast an engineering manager would typically be operating a process that is improving substantially versus the default in some area ( trying a different planning approach, fundamentally different communication items ). Retrospectives would be elevated to "organizational learning" where core new practices are introduced or removed. Engineering managers would be successful taking on more complex project scenarios with complex delivery, or resource tradeoffs, or teams needing growth/support. Engineering manager would routinely partner with others, and benefit from coaching and sounding boards with their manager; and can additionally provide active insight and sounding board about org/team/project issues. 


Comparing the role of engineering manager to senior engineering manager: 

An engineering manager is effective at supporting team members, planning career growth,and responding to challenging employee situations (frustrations between teammates, delivering effective and empathetic performance feedback, hiring and exits, etc. ). When organizational change is occurring engineering managers are effective at supporting that change and providing feedback on roll out. An engineering managers team is well connected and supported. 

A senior engineering manager is effective at growing teams and especially leadership in teams. Dealing productively and directly with cross organizational friction (different delivery practices, different communication, different leadership approaches). Senior engineering managers are identifying organizational change and developing roll out of that change -- always keeping people looped in but sometimes directly making changes to teams and team structures.  A senior engineering manager supports organization facing partnerships and projects.
