Overview

This role involves improving the quality practices of teams in order to improve
the experience of our systems for users. This role emphasizes 
["shift left"](https://medium.com/globant/shift-left-testing-c838521617b0) and
approaches that encourage the idea that "quality is everyone's resposibility". 
In that sense Test Strategist does not typically improve quality by directly 
testing the features, but instead aligning teams around quality goals, enabling
teams with tools and processes, and providing their expertise and industry expertise
to coach teams on risks, release practices, testing, and more.


As well as the role specific competencies below, all tech roles in properly involve
