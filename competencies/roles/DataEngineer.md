Overview

This role is a specialization of the [Developer](./Developer.md) role (including
 [General Properly Competencies](./_TechWideGeneral.md)) with an emphasis on the developer competencies 
such as System Design (since data manipulation tends to have system wide considerations). Additionally there are 
data engineering specific competencies outlined below. 

The DataEngineer role most often works closely with other Developers and with DataScience and DataAnalyst roles.
