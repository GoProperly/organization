Feedback and future considerations 

From @Gavin in PR: 

>I like the framing of "company expects from employee: ..." and 
"employee should expect from company: ...". "Expectations" is a 
useful term, and that framing offers an opportunity to highlight 
"how we support you" in addition to "how you are rewarded/evaluated/etc.".
